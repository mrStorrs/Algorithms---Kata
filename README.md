# Kata
 All the algorithms I have completed on codewars.com
 
 For those that do not know what code wars is a little description:
 
 codewars is a website that has a ton of algorithms to solve for every language.
 Most of the algorithms are authored by it's users. The difficulty of the algorithim
 is determined by the number next to the Kata. Kata 8 being the easiest and Kata 1
 being the hardest.
 
 You will notice that some of the problems seem similar. I pick the Kata that I do by
 random and choose not to skip any whether or not they seem similar to others. This 
 both reinforces what I already know, and gives me a chance to solve the problem a
 differant way. It also ensures that I do not skip a problem because I find it too
 difficult.
 
 One more note: 
 Some of the methods may have multiple solutions that I have figured out. Instead of
 just rewriting the method, I plan on commenting out the one I find less efficent and 
 leaving the one I find to be a "better" solution. This will allow me to see my growth
 and leaves some creativity with coming up with differant solutions to the same problems.
